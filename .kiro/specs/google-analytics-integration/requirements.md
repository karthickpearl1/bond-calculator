# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature adds Google Analytics integration to the bond return calculator SPA to track user interactions and usage patterns. The integration will be simple and focused on tracking page views, user engagement sessions, and calculation events without over-engineering a full analytics platform.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a product owner, I want to track user interactions with the bond calculator, so that I can understand how users engage with the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits the application THEN the system SHALL send a page view event to Google Analytics
2. WHEN a user performs a bond calculation THEN the system SHALL track this as a custom event in Google Analytics
3. WHEN a user changes input parameters (bond details, exit year, sale price) THEN the system SHALL track these interactions as events
4. WHEN a user switches currency THEN the system SHALL track this preference change as an event

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a product owner, I want to track user sessions across different times of the day, so that I can understand usage patterns and session frequency.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user opens the application at different times THEN the system SHALL track each session separately
2. WHEN a user returns to the application after a period of inactivity THEN the system SHALL start a new session
3. WHEN a user keeps the application open but uses it at different times THEN the system SHALL track continued engagement within the same session
4. IF a user performs calculations at different times in the same browser session THEN the system SHALL track each calculation event with timestamps

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a simple Google Analytics implementation, so that I can maintain the code easily without complex analytics infrastructure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing the analytics THEN the system SHALL use Google Analytics 4 (GA4) with minimal configuration
2. WHEN adding tracking code THEN the system SHALL not require additional external dependencies beyond the GA4 script
3. WHEN the application loads THEN the system SHALL initialize Google Analytics with a single configuration
4. IF Google Analytics fails to load THEN the system SHALL continue to function normally without breaking the user experience
5. WHEN tracking events THEN the system SHALL use simple event names and parameters without complex data structures

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want my privacy to be respected, so that my personal data is handled appropriately.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Google Analytics is loaded THEN the system SHALL only track anonymous usage data
2. WHEN tracking events THEN the system SHALL not collect personally identifiable information
3. WHEN a user visits the application THEN the system SHALL respect browser privacy settings and ad blockers
4. IF analytics tracking is blocked THEN the system SHALL continue to function without errors or degraded performance
